  def install
    # Filedrawer's install builds its Swift helper, so the package scripts have
    # to run. Electron's app is left out: Homebrew would try to rewrite its
    # libraries and fail, and Filedrawer doesn't need it here, since the first
    # run downloads it and builds Filedrawer.app in ~/Applications from it.

  def caveats
    <<~EOS
      Start it with:
        filedrawer
      The first run downloads Electron and sets up Filedrawer.app in
      ~/Applications, so it can be opened again from Spotlight, and asks for
      the permissions it needs to open folders in place of Finder.
